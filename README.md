# BWC - British Wildlife Conservation

This website has been created in order to promote a fictional British charity the British Wildlife Conservation or BWC. The BWC relies on donations form supporters and to reward patrons they release a weekly newsletter which includes details about wildlife conservation. 

The site is made up of 4 pages; The landing page, Meet The Team, Our Goals and Sign up. Each page being semantically linked using the same header and title area but containing different images and content. 

Usability of the BWC site on different screen sizes was at the forefront of the design. Multiple media queries and the use of flex box properties allows for the BWC site to adapt to different devices. 

As well as display on different screen types - *aria labels ect*


## Features

### Header
The header area of the BWC site was created by using an image of a forest and decreasing the opacity in order to blend it into the site and not clash with the header text. The Header text displays 'BWC' on small screen and 'BWC - British Wildlife Conservation' on larger screen sizes. 

### Navigation
Directly beneath the header there is the navigation bar. The navigation bar includes the 4 headings of: Home, Meet The Team, Our Goals, Sign Up. The order of these remains consistent on all of the pages of the site. I chose the top of the document to contain the navigation links as this is what users expect to see from all websites. 

Similarly to the Header the navigation bar features dynamic changes depending on the size of the screen. On larger devices a Font Awesome icon is positioned to the right of the heading. The Font Awesome icons are used to be semantically similar to the header it's self and also convey the idea of nature and conservation. 

### Hero Image 
On each of the 4 pages of this site there is a hero Image designed to take up the full width of the page and a height determined by the width of the users device either 600px or 400px. Each of the pages feature a different image of British wildlife including honeybees (on the home screen), a woodpecker, a red squirrel and a pine marten. 

### Hero Image Conent Boxes
Within the hero image there are two boxes positioned close to the upper-right and lower-left of the hero image. The top box contains both the abbreviated and full name of the BWC. The lower box denotes which page the user is on as well as the same Font Awesome icon used in the header. 

### Content Area
Below the hero image there is the content area of the website. The content is separated by headings and horizontal line elements to assist the user. Within several of the sub-headings there ar photographs these are positioned below the text on small devices and to the side on larger screen sizes, alternating between left and right. 

### Footer
Within the footer area of the document there are 4 links to social media platforms arranged in a list and separated to spread the width of the screen. Each of the social media links also contains the equivalent Font Awesome icon.
